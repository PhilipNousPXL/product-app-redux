# Redux demo app

This is a minimal project used to illustrate the use of the flux design pattern.
Redux is used for the actual implementation.

### Running the project 

- `npm start` — This will spawn a development server with a default port of `5173`.
- `npm run build` — This will output a production build in the `dist` directory.
- `npm run preview` — This will run the production build locally with a default port of `5173` (this will not work if you haven't generated the production build yet).

This project was generated using [nano-react-app](https://github.com/nano-react-app/nano-react-app).
